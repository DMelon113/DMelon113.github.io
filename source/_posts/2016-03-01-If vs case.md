As Jonah S. says “I generally try to avoid case statements simply because it makes it easy for me or another programmer to come along in the future and add another case, increasing the branching in a bit of code that should probably have only done one thing in the first place.” When you use a case statement, you obviously create a case. And later, if you go back to your original code and create another case, then you can have issues when trying to use these two different cases to do different things and you will most likely receive an error message in terminal. If/else statements are usually considered faster than case statements because case statements “implicitly compares using the more expensive === operator”.  Although, sometimes, a case statement can be more concise than an if/else statement and conciseness is always good for a coder because it makes things easier to do and take less time when working on a program. A case statement uses when to define what something should display or do, when a certain keyword is inputted. An example:
 
Puts “What sport do you play”
sport = gets.chomp
case sport
when sport = football
        	puts “yay!”
when sport = baseball
        	puts “boo!”
end
 
 
This here is an example of how you would use a case statement. Here is an example of an if/else statement
 
Puts “What sport do you play”
sport = gets.chomp
 
if sport == football
        	puts “yay”
else
        	puts “boo”
end
 
Here we changed the way we were expressing our opinions on sports. Instead having the “case sport” line there, you could just drop that line and do what I did above. This illustrates how multiple cases can be confusing. If you do make multiple case statements, you need to be sure that their names are different from each other. Also when using an if/else statement you have use ranges more than exact values or else you need to make a new block of code to do another if statement.
