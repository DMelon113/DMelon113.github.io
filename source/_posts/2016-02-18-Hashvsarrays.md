Arrays and Hashes are two similar objects that have small differences and are effective in different situations. Both are used to store data that you input. That data could be a string, an integer, a float, and it is also possible to embed a hash within an array and an array inside a hash. Each item in the list can be displayed in a different method, depending on if it is an array or a hash. There are different times when you would want to use an array, and when you would want to use a hash. One reason to use a hash would be when you are writing a very long program and need to reference different arrays/hashes many times. In arrays, the way to call something from :random_array would be : puts random_array[0] or whichever item from the array you would wish to display. Since the way to call on an item in an array would be to put the array name, brackets then the number that corresponds with the item. In an array, the first item is 0, the second is 1 the third is 2, etcâ€¦ When you are doing this, you will not remember which item you are actually calling until you run it. Using a hash fixes this problem because in order to call and item in a has you have to put the name of the hash, a colon, then the name of the item in the has that you wish to call. This makes it apparent to the writer which item they are calling upon. Also, you can be much more creative when using a hash. You set it so that when one of the keys in the hash is called, something other that that key is displayed. If you were to do that in an array you would have to create a variable then put that into the array, which is less efficient than just using a hash.
