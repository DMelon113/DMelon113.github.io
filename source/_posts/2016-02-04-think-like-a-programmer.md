In order to succeed in learning how to program successfully, you has to have a “growth mind” when learning hot to program and code. You need to be able to try new things or else, you are not going to be able to learn anything that will help you progress and grow your programming intellect. Having a “growth mind” means that you are more interested in learning new things and practicing them instead of just getting easy things right all of the time. This relates a lot to what we are doing in class because we are trying new things before we really learn them so the members of the class need to know that the things that they try to start out with when doing an activity may not work at all. Our class structure would not lend well to someone who has a “fixed mind”. They would not want to put full effort into the exercises because they would be afraid of trying new things and getting it wrong in front of their peers. Having a “fixed mind” will stifle your development in learning to program by not allowing you to try new things. Since not many people come into learning to program with much background knowledge, you will probably have to take risks and be wrong in front of people in order to further enhance your knowledge and speed of coding. Thus having a “growth mind” is pretty much necessary when learning to program. It is necessary because then one can take risks by trying to do something that they have not done before or have had no experience with. Doing this will allow one to retain the knowledge that you gain from trying things without knowing exactly how to do it at first. You will be a better programmer if you try things that you haven’t done before instead of doing the easy thing over and over again because you don’t want to be wrong in front of the class.
